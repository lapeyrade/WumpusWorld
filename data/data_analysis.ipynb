    "# Wumpus World Unity Environment Log Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains our analysis of performance logs from different AI agent implementations in the Wumpus World Unity environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compare execution times and behavioral patterns across multiple scenarios with varying complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on different AI types including:\n",
    "- Basic Rule-based agents\n",
    "- Finite State Machine agents\n",
    "- Behavior Tree agents\n",
    "- Prolog agents\n",
    "- Prolog Meta Interpreter agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Each scenario uses different configurations of world size, number of agents, and dangers (pits and Wumpus) distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common parameters across all configurations:\n",
    "| Parameter | Value |\n",
    "|:----------|:------|\n",
    "| **randomSeed** | 1 |\n",
    "| **nbGold** | 1 |\n",
    "| **nbAgent** | [1, 5, 10] |\n",
    "| **aiType** | [Basic, FiniteStateMachine, BehaviorTree, Prolog, PrologMetaInterpreter] |\n",
    "| **personalities** | [(cupid & brave), (ascetic & coward), (cupid & coward)] |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid-Specific Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "| Grid Size | Number of Pits & Wumpus |\n",
    "|:---------:|:-------------:|\n",
    "| 10x10     | 3          |\n",
    "| 15x15     | 7          |\n",
    "| 20x20     | 12         |\n",
    "| 25x25     | 19         |\n",
    "| 30x30     | 27         |\n",
    "| 50x50     | 75         |\n",
    "| 100x100   | 300        |\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 7 grid sizes, 3 personality sets, 5 AI types, and 3 agent numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are `7*3*5*3=315` configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Files are stored in the `data` directory (same as this file). The data is organized in subdirectories based on the grid size:\n",
    "- 10x10\n",
    "- 15x15\n",
    "- 20x20\n",
    "- 25x25\n",
    "- 30x30\n",
    "- 50x50\n",
    "- 100x100\n",
    "\n",
    "Each json file follows the naming convention:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<grid_size>_<nb_agents>_<nb_wumpus_pits>_<nb_gold>_<personality1>_<personality2>_<ai_type>.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a 10x10 grid with 1 agent, 3 wumpus, 3 pits, and 1 gold, using the Cupid and Coward personalities with a Basic AI type, the file would be in folder `10x10` under the name:\n",
    "```\n",
    "10x10/10x10-1a-3wp-1g-Cupid-Coward-Basic.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each JSON file contains an array with two objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Game Configuration and Performance Data**:\n",
    "    - `randomSeed`: The seed used for randomization\n",
    "    - `gridMin` & `gridMax`: Boundaries of the grid\n",
    "    - `tileSize`: Size of each tile\n",
    "    - `nbPit`, `nbWumpus`, `nbGold`: Number of pits, wumpuses, and gold\n",
    "    - `nbAgent`: Number of agents\n",
    "    - `aiType`: Type of AI used (Basic, Prolog, BehaviourTree, etc.)\n",
    "    - `personalities`: Array of personality type IDs\n",
    "    - `isGameOver`: Whether the game has ended\n",
    "    - `isModeAuto`: Whether the game is running in automatic mode\n",
    "    - `turnDuration`: Array of turn durations in milliseconds\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Behavior Data**:\n",
    "    - `agent`: Agent identifier\n",
    "    - `actions`: Array of actions taken by the agent\n",
    "    - `positions`: Array of position objects, with x,y coordinates for each turn\n",
    "\n",
    "See [10x10/10x10-1a-3wp-1g-Cupid-Coward-Basic.json](10x10/10x10-1a-3wp-1g-Cupid-Coward-Basic.json) for an example of the data structure."
