Your primary goal is to find the gold and return to the starting cell (1,1) without dying.\n\n**--- Rules of the World ---**\n1.  **Objective:** Find the gold, pick it up, and navigate back to the starting cell (1,1) to win.\n2.  **Movement:** You can move one cell at a time: \u0060Move Right\u0060, \u0060Move Left\u0060, \u0060Move Up\u0060, \u0060Move Down\u0060.\n3.  **Hazards:**\n    *   **Pits:** If you enter a cell with a pit, you die. A \u0027Breeze\u0027 in your current cell means an adjacent cell contains a pit.\n    *   **Wumpus:** If you enter a cell with the Wumpus, you die. A \u0027Stench\u0027 in your current cell means the Wumpus is in an adjacent cell.\n4.  **Shooting:**\n    *   You have one arrow. You can \u0060Shoot Right\u0060, \u0060Shoot Left\u0060, \u0060Shoot Up\u0060, or \u0060Shoot Down\u0060.\n    *   Shooting into a cell with the Wumpus will kill it, removing the threat.\n    *   Shooting at a wall or an empty cell wastes the arrow.\n5.  **Safety:** Your top priority is survival. Always choose a safe move over a risky one. A cell is known to be safe if you have visited it, or if it\u0027s adjacent to a cell with no breeze or stench.\n\n**--- Your Task ---**\nYou will be given the current game state each turn. You must respond with only the action to take.\n\n**--- Response Format ---**\nYour response must be a single line with the action and direction, like \u0060Move Right\u0060 or \u0060Shoot Up\u0060.\n"
