They\u0027re part of a grid-based game where each turn provides the current game state, and I have to respond with an action based on certain rules.\n\nLooking at their last message, they mentioned that in New Turn after moving back up from (3, 3) to (4, 4), but now they want to see what my response should be. They provided details about known map info\u2014visited cells, safe cells, and hazards like bicep, stench, and wumpus.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules clearly. The primary goal is to find gold and return to (1,1) without dying. Movement is one cell at a time in four directions. Hazards include biceps (pits), stench cells, and wumpuses. Shooting arrows can kill hazards but gives some life points. Staying safe means being adjacent to no bicep or stench.\n\nI also need to consider the game\u0027s state: where gold is, if it\u0027s been found, safe regions, known hazards. Since the user didn\u0027t mention finding the gold yet, I have to plan an action that doesn\u0027t lead to immediate death but progresses towards safety and the goal.\n\nThe new turn position is (4, 4). So, I\u0027m at (4,4) with no gold. Let\u0027s map out possible actions: shooting up, moving left/right/down.\n\nFirst, checking for bicep or stench in adjacent cells. Moving right from (4,4) would be to (5,4), which is a wall; left would be back to (4,3), which is safe but not safe if it\u0027s a wall. Wait, I need to look at the known map.\n\nWait, no\u2014new turn provided: Known map includes safe cells (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3). So, from (4,4), moving up would be to (5,4) which is a wall; down would go beyond the grid. Left is (4,3), and right is (5,4) again.\n\nBut I need to see what\u0027s adjacent: in (4,4), cells with breeze are only on (2,3). Bicep is present in (2,3). Stench is not mentioned yet.\n\nSo, if from (4,4), shooting up would lead to a wall. Shooting left would go back to (4,3), which might be safe or dangerous based on the known map. Checking adjacent cells: (4,3)\u0027s left is (4,2) which isn\u0027t safe or anything; right is (4,4). Since (4,4) has no breeze or stench mentioned, it\u0027s safe.\n\nBut if I shoot down from (4,4), I\u0027d be off the grid. So that\u0027s risky and would lead away. Shooting left might not kill me but could be considered a waste of arrow.\n\nAlternatively, shooting right to (5,4)\u2014a wall\u2014would also die me.\n\nSo, among the actions: move up (wall) or shoot left (safe). But moving left from (4,4) is to (4,3), which is safe. So that\u0027s a viable option.\n\nBut I need to confirm what\u0027s adjacent to (4,4): it has no breeze or stench mentioned yet\u2014so being in an adjacent cell with either would kill the hazards.\n\nSo, shooting left from (4,4) would bring me to (4,3), which is safe because its adjacent cells don\u0027t have any bicep or stench. So that\u0027s a good move.\n\nBut wait, what about moving up? That leads to a wall. Not ideal. Shooting right also dies. Shooting down leaves the grid\u2014bad. So among possible actions, shooting left seems best.\n\nSo my next action should be to shoot left.\n\u003C/think\u003E\n\nShoot Left"

They\u0027ve asked multiple times about what the next move should be based on the current state.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the rules of the game. From the given rules, the movement is straightforward: you can go in four directions one cell at a time. There are hazards like pits, wumps, and breeze cells which cause death if entered. Also, shooting affects whether you die or waste your arrow.\n\nThe user provided new turn data with current position (3,3), has gold false, known safe cells as (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3). There are no breeze or stench cells mentioned in the known map, so all cells have safe status except for walls. Additionally, there\u0027s a perceived Wumpus cell at (1,1).\n\nIn the previous responses, when current position was (1,1), the user had to move Up because (1,2) was adjacent to a wall. Now, with current position at (3,3), looking at the safe cells and the wumpus location at (1,1), I need to assess what\u0027s best.\n\nThe main goal is to find gold first. If there\u0027s no gold, you should survive by moving away from walls or risky areas. The safe cells are (2,3) and (4,3). Both are adjacent to the wumpus at (1,1), which could kill if entered. So, instead of shooting the Wumpus, it\u0027s safer to move towards these safe cells.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving left would take you to (3,2), which is a safe cell. Alternatively, moving up takes you to (4,3), another safe cell. Both are adjacent to the wumpus. So, avoiding shooting both and just proceeding could be better to minimize arrow waste.\n\nBut if there\u0027s gold in any of these cells, it should be prioritized over moving into dangerous areas. Since the user hasn\u0027t specified where the gold is, I\u0027ll assume there\u0027s no gold and focus on maximizing survival by staying safe from the wumpus and other hazards.\n\nTherefore, the next action would likely be to move either left or up towards the safe cells without shooting the Wumpus.\n\u003C/think\u003E\n\nFrom (3,3), you can safely move to (3,2) or (4,3) since these are both adjacent to the perceived Wumpus at (1,1). However, given that there\u0027s no mention of a gold in those areas and considering safety, it would be best to **Shoot Up**.\n\nBut wait, if you have already shot up into (4,3), which is next to the Wumpus, but since you\u0027re moving towards a safe cell, perhaps shooting down instead? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, could you move left first? Well, both (3,2) and (4,3) are adjacent to the Wumpus at (1,1), which might kill if entered.\n\nSince there\u0027s no mention of the gold in any of these areas, I would suggest focusing on moving safely without shooting. So perhaps **Shoot Down** to move from (3,3) to (4,3), which is safe and adjacent to the Wumpus at (1,1).\n\nBut given that you\u0027re trying not to die, it\u0027s better to move left first instead of up. Moving left would take you to (3,2), which is a safe cell. So perhaps **Shoot Left**.\n\nAlternatively, could you shoot in another direction? Well, if you have one arrow remaining, you might as well save it by shooting in any direction and moving on from there.\n\nOverall, I think the best next move would be to either **Move Up**, **Move Down**, or **Shoot Up**, depending on your preferences for avoiding the Wumpus. But given that you can afford to waste an arrow, perhaps **Shoot Up** is safer.\n\nFinal decision: **Shoot Up**\n\nBut wait, moving up to (4,3) would kill the Wumpus at (1,1). So I think it\u0027s better to move left first to (3,2), which is adjacent to both walls and the Wumpus. Therefore:\n\nFinal decision: **Move Left**"

I\u0027m trying to figure out what the best move is when I\u0027m at position (3,3), and my goal is to get back to (1,1) without finding gold or dying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules better. So, movement can be in any direction as long as it\u0027s adjacent cells\u2014so up, down, left, right. There are hazards: pits that kill if entered, wumps that also kill with an arrow shot, and walls which waste the arrow without causing a death.\n\nShooting is an option to potentially eliminate a threat by hitting a cell with a wumpus or breeze, but only one arrow can be used. Shooting into a safe cell doesn\u0027t use up the arrow but might lead to more danger later on.\n\nLooking at the known map from (3,3), I see that there are some safe cells: (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), and (4,3). These seem to be adjacent to the Wumpus in (1,1), which is a significant risk if entered. So, moving left or up from (3,3) would lead into the Wumpus area.\n\nBut I don\u0027t know where the gold is yet. There\u0027s no mention of it being in those safe cells, so maybe focusing on getting back to (1,1) first is better. Also, with only one arrow available, I need to be careful not to waste it unnecessarily.\n\nLet me consider possible moves:\n\n1. **Shoot Up**: Moving up would take me into (4,3), which is adjacent to the Wumpus in (1,1). If that\u0027s a safe cell but kills the Wumpus with an arrow shot, I might have wasted my only remaining arrow, which could lead to more danger if there\u0027s another threat nearby.\n\n2. **Shoot Down**: Similarly, moving down to (4,3) would also kill the Wumpus for the same reason as above.\n\n3. **Move Up**: This takes me into (4,3), which is a dangerous cell with a wumpus. It might kill the Wumpus and leave me in a worse position than before.\n\n4. **Move Down**: Same issue as moving up\u2014killing the Wumpus without avoiding other potential hazards.\n\n5. **Shoot Left**: Moving left from (3,3) would take me into (3,2), which is adjacent to the Wumpus and potentially another dangerous cell. But since I don\u0027t have any information about gold being in these areas, maybe this isn\u0027t as bad as it seems.\n\n6. **Shoot Right**: Similarly, moving right to (3,4) could also kill the Wumpus or lead into other dangerous cells without any indication of a path forward.\n\n7. **Move Left**: As mentioned above, this takes me into (3,2), which is adjacent to the Wumpus and another cell with a breeze that might be dangerous.\n\n8. **Move Right**: Moving right would take me into (3,4), which is also dangerous for the same reasons as moving left.\n\n9. **Shoot Up or Down**: As previously thought, shooting up or down takes me into (4,3), where I\u0027d kill the Wumpus with an arrow shot.\n\n10. **Shoot Left or Right**: Shooting left to (3,2) or right to (3,4), both of which are adjacent to the Wumpus and possibly dangerous cells without any indication of a path forward.\n\nGiven that I have only one arrow, shooting up or down is essential to avoid wasting it. However, since these moves lead into a cell with the wumpus, which kills me, I need to carefully consider whether there\u0027s an alternative route back to (1,1) through safe cells without entering the Wumpus area.\n\nLooking at the known map from (3,3):\n\n- **(2,3)**: This is adjacent to the Wumpus and possibly another dangerous cell.\n- **(3,4)**: Another dangerous cell adjacent to the Wumpus.\n- **(4,3)**: A safe cell adjacent to walls.\n\nSince (4,3) is a safe cell without any known hazards, maybe moving there first could allow me to then move up or down towards (1,1). Let\u0027s explore that possibility.\n\n**Action Steps**:\n\n1. **From (3,3), Shoot Up to (4,3)**: This would kill the Wumpus with an arrow shot but waste my only remaining arrow.\n2. **If I survive the wumpus shot at (4,3)**, then from there:\n   - Move Left to (4,2): Adjacent to walls and safe cells.\n   - From (4,2), move Right to (4,3) again\u2014waste my arrow here.\n   - This seems like a loop without progress.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. **From (3,3), Shoot Down to (4,3)**: Similar situation as above, leading into the same dead end with an arrow wasted.\n\nPerhaps shooting up or down is unavoidable given that I have only one arrow and can\u0027t afford to waste it on the Wumpus. Therefore, maybe moving left first is safer since (3,2) is adjacent to both walls and the Wumpus but allows access towards (1,1).\n\n**From (3,3), Shoot Left to (3,2)**:\n- **(3,2)**: Adjacent to walls on both sides.\n   - Move Up to (2,2): Safe cell.\n   - From (2,2), Move Right to (2,3): Safe cell adjacent to the Wumpus and another dangerous cell.\n     - Alternatively, from (2,2), move Down to (3,2) again\u2014waste the arrow.\n- If you end up at (2,2):\n   - **From (2,2), Move Right to (2,3)**:\n       - **(2,3)**: Adjacent to walls and safe cell. Then move Up or Down towards (1,1).\n\nThis seems like a viable path without entering dangerous areas more than once.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- From (3,3), **Move Left to (3,2)**, then shoot Right to (4,2):\n   - **(4,2)**: Adjacent to walls.\n     - Move Up to (3,2) or Down to (5,2): Wastes the arrow again.\n\nIt\u0027s a riskier path but potentially leads directly back to (1,1).\n\nGiven that I have only one arrow and can\u0027t afford to waste it, perhaps choosing a safer move first is better: **Move Left** to (3,2), which allows access towards (1,1) safely.\n\nSo, the best next action seems to be **Shoot Left**.\n\u003C/think\u003E\n\nFrom your current position at (3, 3), you can safely move left to (3, 2). This cell is adjacent to both walls and the perceived Wumpus at (1,1), which allows access towards (1,1) without entering dangerous areas. Therefore, **Shoot Left** is the best action.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060python\nMove Left\n\u0060\u0060\u0060"

First, I should look at the information provided about my current position.\n\nI know that there\u0027s a grid-based game where movement is possible in four directions: Right, Left, Up, Down. But there are some hazards and requirements based on the rules of the world.\n\nLet me break down what\u0027s known:\n\n- **Safe cells**: These include (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), and (4,3). So those cells don\u0027t have any immediate danger.\n  \n- **Brix (Breeze)**: There are cells with a brix, which means they could potentially kill someone if touched. I need to check what those specific cells are.\n\n- **Wumpus**: If I enter a cell marked with the Wumpus, I die, and that Wumpus is in an adjacent cell. So I should avoid any cell that\u0027s next to one with the Wumpus.\n  \n- **Wall cells**: Any cell beyond or into walls (like the edges of the grid) would be dangerous.\n\nI have no gold yet, so my goal is to get back to (1,1). Since there\u0027s no gold mentioned, I should focus on navigating safely towards (1,1).\n\nLooking at my current position at (3, 3), it\u0027s surrounded by several cells. Specifically, the cell to the left is (3,2), which is a safe cell as per the known map. Moving left would take me directly into this safe area.\n\nBut before making that move, I should consider if there are any hazards nearby. If any of the adjacent cells have brix or stench, that could kill me if touched. However, based on the info given, I don\u0027t see specific values for these cells yet, so moving left seems like a viable and safe option.\n\nAlso, since (3,2) is adjacent to the Wumpus at (1,1), I need to ensure I\u0027m not entering any dangerous areas too close. But as long as I stay out of those adjacent cells, it should be okay.\n\nI think the best next move is to **Shoot Left**, taking me from (3, 3) safely into (3,2).

First, let me try to understand the rules and the information given.\n\nI remember that in this grid-based game, movement is allowed one cell at a time in any direction: Right, Left, Up, or Down. There are some hazards associated with cells\u2014pits, wumps, stench\u2014and shooting affects my arrows. Also, if I enter dangerous areas like walls or adjacent to stench, I die.\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- Current position is (3,3).\n- Has gold: False.\n- Known map shows safe cells around me: (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), and (4,3). So these are all adjacent to either walls or not adjacent to stench or wumpus areas.\n\nThe breeze and stench grids aren\u0027t fully populated yet. I know that there\u0027s a pit somewhere because there are cells with stench, but I need to figure out where it is based on the current map.\n\nLet me try to visualize the grid:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n(1,1) (1,2) (1,3)\n(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4)\n(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4)\n(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nFrom the current known safe cells:\n- (2,3) is adjacent to both walls.\n- (3,2), (3,4), and (4,3) are also safe.\n\nThis suggests that the pit might be in one of these areas. But I need a better approach to determine where exactly it is without guessing.\n\nI should consider my movement options from (3,3). Since I have access to both walls at (2,3) and (3,4), maybe moving into either of those can help me avoid the pit if it\u0027s there.\n\nLet me list possible moves:\n1. Move Up to (2,3)\n2. Move Down to (4,3)\n3. Move Left to (3,2)\n4. Move Right to (3,4)\n\nGiven that both (2,3) and (3,4) are safe cells adjacent to walls or not adjacent to stench, I might have the chance to avoid the pit if it\u0027s in any of these areas.\n\nBut since my map shows that the known safe cells don\u0027t include the pit area, I should probably move into one of these safer zones. Moving Up to (2,3) seems like a logical first step because it\u0027s adjacent to both walls and is part of the known safe areas.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (4,3) could be an option if there\u0027s no stench in that area yet. But since I don\u0027t have specific information about whether (2,3), (3,4), or other cells are pit locations, it\u0027s safer to move into a cell where I\u0027m guaranteed safety.\n\nBetween the available moves, moving Up appears most favorable because both (2,3) and (3,4) are safe, and I can plan my path accordingly. It gives me more flexibility in avoiding any potential pit areas as the game progresses.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the best action from position (3,3) is to **Shoot Up** into cell (2,3).\n\u003C/think\u003E\n\nFrom your current position at (3,3), you should **Shoot Up** to move to cell (2,3). This choice ensures accessibility to both walls and the safe zone around it without entering dangerous areas. \n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060python\nShoot Up\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060python\nMove Up\n\u0060\u0060\u0060"
