## The Game: Rules & Objective
*   The game unfolds in a grid-based cave, home to pits, gold, and the fearsome Wumpus.
*   **Objective**: The agent must find the gold and return to the starting cell without perishing.
*   **Hazards**: Falling into a pit or encountering a Wumpus is fatal.
*   **Perception**:
    *   A **Breeze** in a cell indicates an adjacent pit.
    *   A **Stench** in a cell signals a Wumpus in a neighboring cell.
*   **Agent Abilities**:
    *   Move one cell at a time (up, down, left, right).
    *   Shoot a limited number of arrows to attempt to kill a Wumpus.
*   **Game End**: The game concludes if the agent dies or successfully exits the cave with the gold.

## Running the Game

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jcIbTZh.png" width="600" alt="GameManager Configuration in Unity Inspector">
</p>
<p align="center"><em>GameManager component in the Unity Inspector for game configuration.</em></p>

### Configuration Options
Before starting, you can customize the game environment:
1.  In the Unity "Hierarchy" window, select the **"Grid"** GameObject.
2.  In the "Inspector" window, locate the **"Game Manager (Script)"** component and adjust the following settings:

    *   **Is Game Over**: (Read-only during play) Indicates if the game has ended. Can be manually set to freeze the game.
    *   **Is Mode Auto**: Enables continuous automatic play for agents.
        *   **Timer Interval**: If "Is Mode Auto" is true, this sets the delay (in seconds, e.g., 0.5 for 500ms) between each agent's automatic actions.
    *   **Random Seed**: An integer used to initialize the random number generator. The same seed will always produce the same world layout (pits, Wumpus, gold).
    *   **Grid Min & Max**: Vector2Int values defining the grid's dimensions (e.g., Min (0,0) and Max (15,15) creates a 16x16 grid).
    *   **Tile Size**: Visual spacing between cell centers (primarily affects appearance).
    *   **Nb Pit, Wumpus, Gold, Agent**: Specify the quantity of each game element. Ensure the total number of fixed elements (pits, Wumpus, gold, start positions for agents) does not exceed available grid cells.
    *   **AI Type**: Choose the agent's control logic from the dropdown:
        *   `Basic`: Simple ad-hoc if-then-else rules ([`AIBasic.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIBasic.cs)).
        *   `FiniteStateMachine`: Behavior driven by a finite state machine ([`AIFiniteStateMachine.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIFiniteStateMachine.cs)).
        *   `BehaviourTree`: AI using a behavior tree structure ([`AIBehaviourTree.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIBehaviourTree.cs)).
        *   `Prolog`: Decisions made by querying an SWI-Prolog knowledge base ([`AIProlog.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIProlog.cs)).
        *   `LargeLanguageModel`: Experimental AI using an LLM (currently in development, [`AILargeLanguageModel.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AILargeLanguageModel.cs)).
    *   **Personalities**: Assign personality traits to agents (e.g., Brave, Coward, Cupid). Multiple traits can be selected. For the `AIProlog` AI, these personalities are asserted as facts into its knowledge base, influencing its decisions based on Prolog rules.

3.  Click the **Play button** (â–º) at the top of the Unity Editor to start the game with your chosen settings.

## How to Play

### Controls
*   **Manual Control**:
    *   Use the **directional arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)** to have the agent attempt to move in the chosen direction. The AI still governs whether the move is made and what specific action results (e.g., moving, bumping a wall).
*   **Semi-Automatic Play**:
    *   Press the **Space bar** to make the agent perform one AI-determined action.
    *   Press the **Return (Enter) key** for what the user describes as a "randomized action" (this might be AI-specific randomness or a general turn trigger).
*   **Fully Automatic Play**:
    *   Enable the **"Is Mode Auto"** checkbox in the Game Manager settings (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)) for continuous, hands-free agent actions based on the set "Timer Interval".
*   **Other Controls**:
    *   **Escape Key**: Ends the game and, if in the Unity Editor, stops play mode.
    *   **Backspace Key**: Captures a screenshot and saves it to a "Screenshots" folder within your project directory.

## AI Agents Overview
This project explores various AI paradigms for controlling the Wumpus World agent.

### C#-based AIs
These AIs are implemented directly in C# within the Unity environment.
*   **[`AIBasic.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIBasic.cs)**: A straightforward rule-based system. It uses C# [Ontology classes](#c-ontology-classes-explained) (like [`Objective.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Ontology/Objective.cs) and [`Action.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Ontology/Action.cs)) to generate goals, evaluate the utility of possible actions, and execute the best one.
*   **[`AIFiniteStateMachine.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIFiniteStateMachine.cs)**: Implements a classic Finite State Machine where the agent transitions between predefined states (e.g., Exploring, Attacking, Retreating) based on environmental perceptions.
*   **[`AIBehaviourTree.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIBehaviourTree.cs)**: Leverages the [Fluid Behaviour Tree](https://github.com/ashblue/fluid-behaviour-tree) library to create a modular and hierarchical tree of behaviors (sequences, selectors, conditions, actions) that dictate the agent's decisions.

### Prolog-based AI
*   **[`AIProlog.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIProlog.cs)**: This AI delegates its decision-making to an external SWI-Prolog engine.
    *   **Knowledge Representation**: Its understanding of the game world, actions, objectives, and personalities is defined by a set of structured Prolog files (`.pl`) located in `Assets/StreamingAssets/prolog_default/`. These include:
        *   [`main.pl`](Assets/StreamingAssets/prolog_default/main.pl): The core reasoning rules and entry point.
        *   [`action.pl`](Assets/StreamingAssets/prolog_default/action.pl): Ontology for game actions.
        *   [`element.pl`](Assets/StreamingAssets/prolog_default/element.pl): Ontology for game elements (Wumpus, Pit, Gold, Cell types).
        *   [`objective.pl`](Assets/StreamingAssets/prolog_default/objective.pl): Ontology for agent objectives.
        *   [`personality.pl`](Assets/StreamingAssets/prolog_default/personality.pl): Ontology for agent personalities.
    *   **Interface**: Communication is handled by [`PrologInterface.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Prolog/PrologInterface.cs), which sends facts (agent perceptions, selected C# `Personalities`) to the Prolog KB and queries it for the next action.

### Experimental LLM AI
*   **[`AILargeLanguageModel.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AILargeLanguageModel.cs)**: An exploratory AI aiming to use a Large Language Model for agent control. This is currently in the early stages of development and not fully functional.

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Agent Architecture
The agent's behavior and interaction with the world are managed by several key C# scripts:
*   **[`Agent.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/Agent.cs)**: The core script for an agent. It initializes the agent, holds its state (like coordinates, inventory), and manages its various components (AI, personality, actions, objectives).
*   **[`AgentSense.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AgentSense.cs)**: Handles how the agent perceives its environment (e.g., detecting breezes, stenches). Perceptual information is crucial for decision-making.
*   **[`AgentMove.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AgentMove.cs)**: Manages all movement-related logic for the agent, including executing moves to adjacent cells and handling collisions with walls.
*   **[`AgentAction.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AgentAction.cs)**: Responsible for executing non-movement actions, such as picking up gold or shooting an arrow.
*   **[`AgentObjective.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AgentObjective.cs)**: Used primarily by the `AIBasic` AI (and potentially adaptable for others), this component helps in generating high-level goals for the agent (e.g., explore, find gold).

### Prolog Integration Details (`AIProlog`)
The Prolog-based AI ([`AIProlog.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIProlog.cs)) leverages an external SWI-Prolog engine for its decision-making:
*   **[`PrologInterface.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Prolog/PrologInterface.cs)**: This script acts as a bridge between Unity (C#) and SWI-Prolog. It uses SWI-Prolog's Machine Query Interface (MQI) to send queries and receive results. It directly consults `main.pl` upon initialization.
*   **Knowledge Base Files (in `Assets/StreamingAssets/prolog_default/`)**:
    *   **`main.pl`**: This is the primary Prolog file consulted by [`PrologInterface.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Prolog/PrologInterface.cs). It contains the core reasoning logic, predicates, and rules that drive the agent's behavior. It is responsible for consulting the other specialized ontology `.pl` files.
    *   **Ontology Files**: `action.pl`, `element.pl`, `objective.pl`, and `personality.pl`. These files define the detailed ontologiesâ€”hierarchies, properties, and relationshipsâ€”for game actions, elements (like Wumpus, pits, gold, cell types), agent objectives, and personality traits. They provide the structured knowledge representation that `main.pl` uses for reasoning.
*   **Operation**:
    1.  During its turn, [`AIProlog.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIProlog.cs) gathers current agent state (e.g., coordinates, perceived cell contents via [`AgentSense.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AgentSense.cs)) and selected C# `Personalities` (from `GameManager`).
    2.  These are asserted as temporary facts into the Prolog knowledge base via [`PrologInterface.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Prolog/PrologInterface.cs). For instance, a selected C# `Personality` like "Brave" becomes a Prolog fact `brave(agentName, _)`, which `personality.pl` and `main.pl` can then use in their reasoning.
    3.  [`AIProlog.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIProlog.cs) then calls `PrologInterface.QueryKb(...)`, sending the agent's name and coordinates. This triggers the Prolog engine to consult its rule set using all available facts.
    4.  The Prolog engine returns a string representing the suggested action (e.g., "move", "shoot", "pickup").
    5.  [`AIProlog.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AI/AIProlog.cs) then calls the appropriate methods on [`AgentMove.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AgentMove.cs) or [`AgentAction.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Agent/AgentAction.cs) to execute this action.
    6.  The `GameController` also calls `PrologInterface.RunQuery()` at the end of the turn to process any globally accumulated Prolog queries or assertions.

### C# Ontology Classes Explained
Located in `Assets/Scripts/Ontology/`, these C# classes define the conceptual building blocks for game elements and AI logic primarily for the **C#-based AI systems** (`AIBasic`, `AIBehaviourTree`, `AIFiniteStateMachine`) and for representing these concepts within the general C# game logic.
*   **[`Action.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Ontology/Action.cs)**: Base class for all actions an agent can perform (e.g., `Move`, `Attack`, `PickUp`). Includes a `Utility` property used by `AIBasic`.
*   **[`Cell.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Ontology/Cell.cs)**: Represents a cell in the game grid and its properties (e.g., `isVisited`, `hasPit`).
*   **[`Element.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Ontology/Element.cs)**: Base class for game objects like Wumpus, Pit, Gold.
*   **[`Objective.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Ontology/Objective.cs)**: Base class for agent objectives, used by `AIBasic` (e.g., `Explore`, `GetGold`).
*   **[`Personality.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Ontology/Personality.cs)**: Defines various C# personality components (e.g., `Brave`, `Coward`) that can be attached to agents. The names of these selected C# personalities are converted to facts for the Prolog AI, which then uses its own Prolog-defined ontologies (e.g., `personality.pl`) to interpret and reason about these traits.

While the C# `Ontology` classes and the Prolog `.pl` ontology files may cover similar conceptual domains (actions, personalities, etc.), they serve different AI systems. The Prolog ontologies are specifically for the `AIProlog` AI and are defined purely in Prolog, whereas the C# classes are for the C# AIs and engine-level representation.

            GC ->> GM: RecordTurnMetrics(duration, agent_i.coords, agent_i.lastAction)
        end
    end
```
**`AIProlog` Key Participants:**
*   `AIProlog_i`: The `AIProlog` component.
*   `PI`: `PrologInterface` - Bridge to the SWI-Prolog engine.
*   `AM_i`: The `AgentMove` component.

### Data Logging
The game includes a feature to log data from each session:
*   When a game ends (or if `saveData` is enabled in `GameManager`), game metrics and agent history are saved to a JSON file.
*   The data includes: game configuration (seed, grid size, entity counts, AI type, personalities), game outcome, turn durations, and for each agent, a list of all actions taken and their positions at each turn.
*   Files are saved in a `data/` directory (created automatically at the project's root level if it doesn't exist) with a naming convention like: `data/{gridMax.x}x{gridMax.y}-{nbAgent}a-{nbWumpus}wp-{nbGold}g-{string.Join("-", personalities)}-{aiType}.json`.

## Roadmap / Future Work
*   **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize code for larger grids or more complex AI computations, including with the Prolog AI.
*   **LLM Agent Finalization**: Fully implement and test the `AILargeLanguageModel.cs` agent.
*   **Advanced Prolog Reasoning**: Expand the Prolog knowledge base (`.pl` files) with more sophisticated rules, heuristic strategies, and learning capabilities (e.g., remembering paths, inferring Wumpus locations with more certainty).
*   **Complex Personalities**: Enhance the impact of personalities on AI behavior across all AI types.
*   **UI/UX Improvements**: Develop a more user-friendly in-game UI for configuration, agent status display, and game feedback.
*   **Additional Game Elements**: Introduce new challenges, items, or environmental factors.
*   **Multi-Agent Scenarios**: Explore interactions or collaborations if multiple agents are enabled.
